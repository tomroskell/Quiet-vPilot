# Quiet-vPilot
Hate hearing constant beeps from vPilot? 

This package will silence any error messages, broadcasts, and any text radio messages that aren't directed at you. Incoming private messages will be aproximately half as loud as they were before.

# Installation
1) Locate your vPilot sounds folder (normally AppData\Local\vPilot\Sounds)

2) Drag and replace the sound files with these quieter ones
